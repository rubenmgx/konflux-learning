Here's an explanation of Pipeline as Code (PaC) based on the provided sources:

### What is Pipeline as Code?

**Pipeline as Code (PaC)** is a practice that involves **defining pipelines using source code in Git**. It refers to a subsystem that executes these pipelines. Konflux, a platform designed to help teams develop applications, **uses Pipelines as Code for its pipelines**.

### Key Components

The core components that make up or interact with Pipeline as Code include:

*   **Pipelines**: A pipeline is a collection of tasks executed in a specific order.
*   **PipelineRuns**: A PipelineRun is a process that executes a Pipeline on a cluster with specific inputs, outputs, and execution parameters. **Konflux creates PipelineRuns in response to pull request and push events** in your repository.
*   **Tasks**: Individual steps within a pipeline are called tasks. Tasks can include various functional or security checks performed on the source code or the produced artifact.
*   **Repositories**: PaC works by creating Repository Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs), which specify which repositories it should use.
*   **Secrets**: Secrets, such as those for GitLab access or authentication (e.g., pipelines-as-code-secret), are necessary for PaC functionality and are mounted in the pod for the pipeline. PaC analyzes PipelineRuns to replace secret values with hidden characters to prevent their exposure.
*   **Workspaces**: In the context of PipelineRuns, a persistentVolumeClaim can be used as a volume source for a workspace. While IntegrationTestScenario (ITS) objects don't directly support workspaces, they can point to a pipeline definition file where the workspace is defined.
*   **GitHub/GitLab Integration**: PaC integrates with source control systems like GitHub and GitLab. For GitHub, it uses GitHub Apps for installation and access. For GitLab, secrets need to be configured for GitLab-sourced applications.

### How is Pipeline as Code Built?

Considerations for how Pipeline as Code is built include:

*   **Tekton Templates**: PaC aims to be as close to the Tekton template as possible. Users typically write their templates and save them with a `.yaml` extension in the `.tekton/` directory.
*   **OpenAPI Schema Validation**: PaC provides **OpenAPI schema validation for its Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)**, which aids in writing Repository resources and ensuring their correctness.
*   **Build Definitions**: Initial Tekton pipeline specifications, especially for Docker builds, can be sourced from centralized repositories like `konflux-ci/build-definitions`. These pipelines contain tasks maintained by the Release Team.
*   **Customization**: Once a pipeline is pushed to your repository, it becomes customizable. However, **changes made directly to the Component CR in Konflux will not automatically trigger a proposed pull request to update the Git repository**.
*   **Migrations**: Changes to existing tasks (e.g., adding or removing parameters) and pipeline structures (e.g., requiring new tasks) can be managed through "migrations." A "pipeline-patcher" script can help simplify this process.
*   **Inherited Configuration**: For widespread application of configurations across multiple components, an **inherited configuration** can be set up, typically within a specially named repository like `{{parentOrg}}/renovate-config`.
*   **Multi-architecture Builds**: Multi-platform FBC (File-Based Catalog) pipelines are a requested feature. Examples for multi-arch build pipelines exist, such as in the `olm-operator-konflux-sample` repository. Implementing multi-arch support often involves adding specific sections to both pull and push YAML files.
*   **Hermetic Builds**: For prefetching RPMs in hermetic builds, tools like `rpm-lockfile-prototype` and `cachi2` can be used. However, their file format and underlying technology might change in the future.
*   **YAML Structure and Naming Conventions**: It's crucial for labels to be placed correctly under `metadata`, not as a root attribute in YAML files. Similarly, consistency in `product_version` and `tags` for fields like `synopsis` is important.

### How does Pipeline as Code Work?

PaC functions through:

*   **Event Triggers**: The primary way Konflux initiates PipelineRuns is in response to **pull request and push events** in your repository.
*   **Manual Triggers**: Builds can also be triggered manually by submitting a merge/pull request, or by a project maintainer adding the `/ok-to-test` comment to a pull request.
*   **Dynamic Variables**: Tags within pipelines can leverage dynamic variables provided by Pipelines as Code, such as `pull_request_number`, `source_branch`, or `target_branch`. A comprehensive list of these variables is available in the Pipelines as Code documentation.
*   **Pipeline Reference (`pipelineRef`)**: To promote reusability and simplify configurations, you can use `pipelineRef` to point to a common pipeline file that is referenced by multiple PipelineRuns. This allows for customization of parameters within the common pipeline.
*   **Monorepo Handling**: In monorepos, every pull request can trigger pipelines for every single component. However, specific annotations like `pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-cel-expression` can be used to configure builds to trigger only when changes occur in specific directories.
*   **Error Reporting**: When an error occurs in a pipeline task, a brief excerpt of the last three lines from the task breakdown is displayed. However, API character limits restrict the output to only the first failed task.
*   **Automatic Merging**: Automatic merging of Renovate bot merge requests can be configured, but this requires passing CI tests within the `.tekton` PR pipeline.

### Normal Use Cases of Pipeline as Code

PaC is utilized for various critical operations:

*   **Building Applications and Components**: Its primary function is to **build application components into images from a source repository** and perform initial checks on them.
*   **Defining Custom Build Pipelines**: Users can create and utilize their own custom pipelines, tailored to specific needs not covered by default options.
*   **Releasing Applications**: PaC is a fundamental part of the release process, automating the validation of release conditions and execution of release actions. This includes pushing content to Quay.io and managing releases to the Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog.
*   **Managing Multiple Versions/Streams**: It supports managing multiple product versions or release streams in parallel. This can involve creating separate applications for each version or using mechanisms like the ProjectDevelopmentStreamTemplate to orchestrate builds across different branches.
*   **Automating Dependency Updates**: Tools like Mintmaker and Renovate Bot leverage PaC to keep dependencies (e.g., Git submodules) up to date with upstream changes.
*   **Integration with External Systems**: PaC enables integration with external services such as JIRA, ServiceNow, PagerDuty, Salesforce, and Oracle. It can automate tasks like updating JIRA tickets based on pipeline events.
*   **Security and Compliance Checks**: It facilitates running various security and compliance checks, including SAST (e.g., Coverity), CVE collection, and Enterprise Contract checks.
*   **Comprehensive Testing**: PaC supports different types of testing: build-time tests, custom tests, and integration tests. Integration tests can be configured on an application-wide basis.
*   **Building OLM Operators**: It provides workflows for building OLM Operator, bundle, and File-Based Catalog (FBC) images, including managing image references and generating catalogs.

### Monitoring to Ensure Functionality

To ensure the proper functionality of Pipeline as Code, consider the following monitoring aspects:

*   **PipelineRun Status and Logs**: **Regularly check the status and logs of PipelineRuns** in the Konflux UI for any failures or unexpected behavior [many sources, e.g., 24, 25, 26, 27]. This is the primary method for troubleshooting issues.
*   **Enterprise Contract (EC) Violations**: Pay close attention to the **Security tab in the Konflux UI for detailed information on EC failures** and how to resolve them. EC violations are reported back to GitHub or GitLab.
*   **Conforma Rule Changes**: There's a recognized need for a continuously updated document listing Conforma rules that are transitioning from warnings to violations, including their effective dates, to avoid unexpected blockers. A feature to create a "conforma monitor" is planned to track these issues in the Konflux dashboard.
*   **Jira Integration**: Utilize Jira projects like KONFLUX or KFLUXBUGS to track features, bugs, and overall work related to PaC.
*   **Performance Monitoring**: Be aware of known performance issues, such as "slow performance with variance up to 5x between PipelineRuns" (KFLUXBUGS-1503), which are actively under investigation.
*   **API Reference Documentation**: While a general issue for generating comprehensive API reference documentation for Konflux exists, understanding the structure of ReleasePlan and ReleasePlanAdmission schemas can help validate configurations.
*   **Troubleshooting Guides**: Leverage existing and upcoming troubleshooting tips for common CI errors, which are part of the documentation goals.
*   **SMEE Channels**: For enabling build pipelines and ensuring webhook proxy URLs are correctly configured, monitoring SMEE channels is necessary.
*   **Support Workflows**: When encountering issues, **use the "Ask for Support" workflow** (if available) to ensure questions are tracked and addressed by relevant teams, contributing to clearer documentation and improved functionality.
