The **API server** acts as the **front-end for the Kubernetes control plane** within Konflux, exposing the Kubernetes API. It is the central management entity that processes REST requests, performs validation, and updates the state of API objects, which are then persisted in the `etcd` database.

Here's the context of the API server's usage and associated considerations in Konflux:

*   **Core Functionality and Interactions**:
    *   The API server is fundamental for **managing all resources** in Konflux, including `Applications`, `Components`, `ImageRepositories`, and `IntegrationTestScenarios`.
    *   **Users interact with it via CLI tools** like `kubectl` or `oc`, allowing them to create, delete, or view secrets, applications, and other resources within their namespaces.
    *   **Pipelines as Code (PaC)** relies on the API server for various operations, including triggering `PipelineRuns` and interacting with Git providers (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
    *   **Release processes** involve interactions with the API server for creating ReleasePlanAdmission (RPA) objects and managing release-related configurations.
    *   The **Tekton Results service** also heavily interacts with the API server to store and query pipeline run logs and results.

*   **Observed Issues and Challenges**:
    *   **Performance and Unresponsiveness**: The API server has experienced **load issues and unresponsiveness**, sometimes leading to CPU/memory starvation on masters, which can cause both `etcd` and the API server to go down. This can manifest as 5xx errors (e.g., 500, 502, 503) from the UI and API calls.
    *   **Forbidden Errors (403)**: Users frequently encounter "Forbidden" errors when attempting to create or access resources due to **insufficient permissions**. These often require granting specific role bindings or using different access methods (e.g., direct API server access instead of proxy).
    *   **Access Control and Proxies**: There are different access points to Konflux clusters. Users can access their namespaces through a **KubeSaw proxy** (`api-toolchain-host-operator`) or directly connect to the **cluster's API server** (`api.stone-prod-*`). The KubeSaw proxy primarily supports SSO users and does not support Service Accounts directly.
    *   **Rate Limiting**: There are **API limits** in place for applications, such as 5,000 requests per hour for PaC, which can cause issues if too many `PipelineRuns` are triggered simultaneously. Quay.io also implements rate limiting which can lead to "too many requests" errors.
    *   **Host Resolution Failures**: During acceptance tests, issues related to API server and Rekor hosts can occur, such as `no such host` errors when trying to resolve `apiserver.localhost`.

*   **Mitigation and Future Development**:
    *   Discussions and efforts are ongoing to **improve stability and address performance bottlenecks** of the API server and related services.
    *   For testing, some users employ **direct API server access** to bypass proxy limitations.
    *   There is a recognized need for better **documentation and guidance** on API usage, authentication, and troubleshooting.
    *   Suggestions have been made to open up direct access to Tekton Results for non-Konflux developers or to increase PipelineRun retention time.
    *   The possibility of a **central OIDC configuration endpoint** for all internal clusters has been raised as a feature request to improve authentication flows for third-party integrations.

More Information:

The **Kubernetes API Server** is the central component of the Kubernetes control plane. It's the front door to the cluster, handling all communication and serving as the primary interface for users, external components, and other control plane elements like the scheduler and controllers. Essentially, it exposes the Kubernetes API and is responsible for managing the cluster's state.

***

### Key Components

The API server's functionality is intertwined with other control plane components, but its core responsibilities are:

* **RESTful API:** It exposes a RESTful API over HTTP, allowing clients to perform **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on Kubernetes resources (e.g., Pods, Services, Deployments).
* **Authentication and Authorization:** The API server is the first point of contact for any request. It authenticates the user or service account making the request and then checks for the necessary permissions using policies like **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to ensure the request is authorized.
* **Validation and Admission Control:** Before a resource is saved, the API server runs it through a series of **admission controllers**. These are plugins that can either validate the resource's configuration or mutate it to conform to specific policies. This is where tools like Kyverno integrate to enforce policies.
* **Data Persistence with etcd:** The API server is the **only** component that directly communicates with **etcd**, Kubernetes' distributed key-value store. It saves the desired state of all Kubernetes objects in etcd and retrieves them when needed.

***

### How is the API server built, something to have in consideration?

The `kube-apiserver` is a single binary that is built to be highly available and scalable. It's designed to be deployed as multiple instances behind a load balancer to handle a high volume of concurrent requests. When considering its architecture, keep in mind:

* **Horizontal Scalability:** You can run multiple instances of the API server to distribute the load and ensure high availability.
* **Stateless by design:** The API server itself is largely stateless. All the persistent state is managed by the etcd datastore, which allows the API server to be easily replicated without complex state synchronization.
* **Security is paramount:** Because it's the gateway to your cluster, the API server must be secured. All communication with it should use TLS encryption.
* **Extensibility:** The API server has an **aggregation layer** that allows you to extend the Kubernetes API with custom resources and controllers, making the platform incredibly flexible.

***

### How does the API server work?

The API server acts as the central hub for all cluster operations. When a request, such as a user running `kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml`, is made, the following sequence of events occurs:

1.  **Request Reception:** The request is received by the API server.
2.  **Authentication:** The API server verifies the identity of the user or service account.
3.  **Authorization:** It checks if the authenticated identity has permission to perform the requested action on the specified resource.
4.  **Admission Control:** The request is passed through admission controllers, which can validate or modify the resource. For example, a pod security policy might be enforced here. 
5.  **Data Persistence:** If all checks pass, the API server updates the resource's state in etcd.
6.  **Broadcast and Reaction:** The API server's change is broadcast to all other components that are "watching" for changes, such as the `kube-scheduler` or a custom controller. These components then react to the new desired state to make the cluster's actual state match it.

***

### Which would be a normal use case for the API server?

A normal use case for the API server is to serve as the **central point of control for cluster management**. This includes:

* **Declarative Management:** A user defines the desired state of their applications and infrastructure using YAML files, and the API server handles the reconciliation. For instance, when you define a Deployment with three replicas, you are simply telling the API server your desired state.
* **Internal Communication:** All internal cluster components communicate through the API server. The `kube-scheduler` watches for new Pods and updates the API server with the node they should be placed on. The `kubelet` on each node watches the API server for Pods assigned to it and reports their status back.
* **Programmatic Access:** The API server's RESTful nature allows for programmatic interaction, which is foundational for building tools, extensions, and automated workflows that interact with the cluster.

***

### What should I have in consideration to monitor to ensure functionality?

Monitoring the API server is critical for maintaining a healthy cluster. You should focus on metrics that provide insight into its performance, health, and security:

* **Request Latency:** Monitor metrics like `apiserver_request_duration_seconds` to identify any slowdowns or performance bottlenecks. High latency can indicate a bottleneck in the API server itself, etcd, or a slow admission webhook.
* **Request Rate and Status:** Track the number of requests per second and their corresponding HTTP status codes. Spikes in `4xx` (client errors) or `5xx` (server errors) can point to authorization issues or internal problems.
* **In-flight Requests:** Keep an eye on `apiserver_current_inflight_requests`. A high number of in-flight requests can suggest that the API server is overwhelmed, potentially due to a "noisy client" or an insufficient number of replicas.
* **etcd Performance:** Since the API server relies on etcd, monitor etcd's request duration and health. If etcd is slow, the API server will be as well.
* **Resource Usage:** Monitor the CPU and memory usage of the API server pods to ensure they have adequate resources.
