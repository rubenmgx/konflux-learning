The Konflux project controller, designed primarily for one-time resource generation, can experience various performance and functional issues due to its design, interactions with other systems, and configuration complexities.

Here are the causes of performance and related issues with the Konflux project controller:

*   **Lack of a Reconciliation Loop (Fundamental Design):**
    *   The project controller is explicitly described as a "one-time thing" used to **generate resources once**, and it **does not possess a reconciliation loop** commonly associated with Kubernetes controllers.
    *   Consequently, if a resource initially created by a template is later modified, its configuration is **not automatically re-aligned** with the template. Manual intervention, such as restarting the controller or explicitly modifying the `Project`, `ProjectDevelopmentStream`, or `ProjectDevelopmentStreamTemplate` resources, is required to resynchronize the state.
    *   Similarly, if a `ProjectDevelopmentStream` changes its template or starts referring to a new one, resources previously owned by it but not defined in the new template **do not get deleted**.

*   **Conflicts and "Fighting" with Other Controllers:**
    *   The project controller utilizes server-side-apply, which can lead to it "fighting" with other controllers that also manage the same attributes of a resource. This can result in **repeated re-onboarding attempts** for applications, creating a continuous loop of configuration application.
    *   This "fighting" state can manifest as the Konflux bot constantly creating pull requests in the upstream repository, **deleting user-desired changes** to pipeline configurations.

*   **Repeated Onboarding Due to `configure-pac` Annotation:**
    *   The project controller can get stuck in a loop of **constant re-onboarding** if the `configure-pac` annotation is not explicitly removed from Project Templates.
    *   This can also occur if template changes inadvertently cause the controller to add this annotation, leading to redundant onboarding processes.

*   **Incomplete Resource Creation and Hidden Errors:**
    *   Users have reported instances where the project controller fails to create all the resources defined in a `ProjectDevelopmentStreamTemplate`, such as `Application`, `Components`, `ReleasePlans`, and `IntegrationTestScenarios`. Often, this happens **without clear error messages** or useful debugging information.
    *   One specific bug observed was the failure to create resources due to **OpenShift naming length limitations** for test names generated by the controller. This unhandled error caused the controller to re-add the `configure-pac` annotation, triggering repeated onboarding attempts.
    *   Issues can arise if a `ProjectDevelopmentStream` is created **before its corresponding template**, or if a component is created **before its application**, causing the controller to prematurely stop processing.

*   **Credential Regeneration Issues:**
    *   Simultaneous creation of multiple component versions (e.g., `v1-0` and `v1.x`) can lead to the **regeneration of Quay.io push/pull credentials**, resulting in 401 errors.

*   **Tight Coupling with UI/Workflow:**
    *   There is a degree of **tight coupling with the UI**, particularly concerning the build service responsible for generating pipeline pull requests. This suggests that certain operations or workflows might implicitly rely on UI interactions, making pure CLI or GitOps approaches prone to unexpected behavior.

*   **Debugging and Observability Challenges:**
    *   A significant challenge for users is the **lack of clear, actionable logs or UI indications** when the project controller fails to create resources or encounters issues, making root cause analysis difficult and time-consuming.
