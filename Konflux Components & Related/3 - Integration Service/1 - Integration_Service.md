The Konflux Integration Service plays a crucial role in ensuring the quality and compatibility of applications within the Konflux platform.

### About the Integration Service

The Integration Service is a **controller** within Konflux that monitors for successful completion of build pipelines. Its primary function is to **ensure that all components within an application are able to work together**. Konflux itself is an internal system designed for building and CI/CD, aiming to meet SLSA Build L3 standards.

### Key Components

The functionality of the Integration Service revolves around several key components:

*   **IntegrationTestScenario (ITS)**: An ITS is a **YAML file that defines an integration test using a Tekton Pipeline**. Konflux executes these tests after successfully building the application components.
    *   **Contexts**: ITS can be configured with "contexts" to determine when they apply, such as `pull_request`, `group`, or `component`. This allows for tests to be specific to certain scenarios or parts of the application.
*   **Snapshot**: After the successful completion of build pipelines, the Integration Service **composes a Snapshot of the application's components**. This snapshot is a compilation of the images of all components.
    *   **Atomic Updates**: Only one reference at a time is updated in a Snapshot, ensuring that each produced artifact can be tested atomically.
    *   **Group Snapshots**: In a monorepo pattern, the Integration Service automatically creates "group Snapshots" for pull requests.
*   **Tekton Pipelines/Tasks**: The IntegrationTestScenario (ITS) contains Tekton Pipelines. Integration tests are ultimately executed as Tekton tasks. Users have the ability to build new custom tasks to extend functionality.
*   **Application and Component**: An "Application" in Konflux is a collection of "Components". Integration tests are typically defined at the application level, with the `spec.application` field pointing to a single Konflux Application. However, ITS can be configured to target specific components within a single application.
*   **Enterprise Contract (EC)**: The Integration Service can enable components within an application to be checked against an Enterprise Contract Policy. These checks are vital for compliance and can act as gating criteria on pull requests. A default EC check might be created if the component is set up via the UI.

### How the Integration Service Works

The workflow of the Integration Service generally follows these steps:

1.  **Triggering Builds**: Konflux builds are initiated by specific events, such as **pull requests or push events**, leading to both pre-merge and post-merge builds. Builds can also be triggered manually by submitting a merge/pull request or by a project maintainer adding the `/ok-to-test` comment.
2.  **Snapshot Creation**: Once a component's build pipeline successfully completes, the Integration Service composes a Snapshot.
3.  **Test Execution**: The Integration Service then runs the user-defined IntegrationTestScenarios (ITS) against this newly created Snapshot.
4.  **Data Flow**: Parameters from the IntegrationTestScenario can be passed to the underlying Tekton PipelineRun. Snapshot data includes references to artifacts and Git information.
5.  **Ephemeral Environments**: Integration tests can be executed in **ephemeral OpenShift instances** managed by Environment-as-a-Service (EaaS). These ephemeral namespaces are typically garbage collected four hours after their creation. In a monorepo, the Enterprise Contract pipeline always runs against the entire snapshot.

### Normal Use Cases of the Integration Service

The Integration Service facilitates various essential development and testing scenarios:

*   **Ensuring Component Compatibility**: Its core purpose is to verify that all components within an application function correctly together.
*   **Enterprise Contract Checks**: It's used for running automated Enterprise Contract checks to ensure compliance and enforce policies, often as a mandatory step for pull requests.
*   **Third-Party Tool Integration**: It supports integrating with external testing services like Testing Farm, Jenkins, RapiDAST, and OpenShift CI (Prow).
*   **Full QE Testing**: Teams explore its capability for comprehensive Quality Engineering (QE) testing pipelines, including deploying dependent services and the application itself into OpenShift instances.
*   **Advanced Testing**: Konflux also supports other testing methodologies like continuous performance testing, chaos testing, and integration with Sealights.
*   **Artifact Gathering**: It can be used for collecting artifacts generated during tests.

### Considerations for Monitoring Service Functionality

To ensure the functionality of the Integration Service, consider the following:

*   **Logs**: When troubleshooting issues, **uploading logs beforehand is crucial** as it helps engineers assess problems faster. Build service logs may need to be examined for issues.
*   **JIRA Tracking**: Issues are often tracked in JIRA projects like KFLUXBUGS or KONFLUX.
*   **Documentation Gaps**: Users frequently report challenges with finding comprehensive documentation, which can hinder troubleshooting and understanding of the service's behavior.
