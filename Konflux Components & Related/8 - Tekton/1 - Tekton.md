Here's an explanation of Tekton, its components, how it works, use cases, and monitoring considerations, based on the provided sources:

### What is Tekton?

**Tekton is a Knative-based framework designed for Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines**. It is the **CI tool that Konflux uses**, meaning Konflux builds, tests, and releases applications using Tekton Pipelines. Tekton is decoupled, allowing a single pipeline to deploy to any Kubernetes cluster across multiple hybrid cloud providers, and it stores all pipeline-related information directly within the cluster. Pipelines as Code (PaC) in Konflux is built on Tekton, aiming to be as close to the Tekton template as possible.

### Key Components

The core components and concepts within Tekton, as referenced in the sources, include:

*   **Tasks**: Tasks are individual steps within a pipeline, composed of one or more container images, each performing a piece of work. They can include various functional or security checks on source code or artifacts.
*   **TaskRuns**: A TaskRun is the process that executes a Task on a cluster with specific inputs, outputs, and execution parameters. Konflux creates TaskRuns as part of a PipelineRun.
*   **Pipelines**: A Pipeline is a collection of Tasks executed in a specific order.
*   **PipelineRuns**: A PipelineRun is the process that executes a Pipeline on a cluster with defined inputs, outputs, and execution parameters. Konflux creates PipelineRuns in response to pull request and push events in your repository [many sources, e.g., 295]. PaC uses PipelineRuns as its base.
*   **Workspaces**: A Tekton workspace is a storage volume that a task needs at runtime for input or output. PersistentVolumeClaims can be used as volume sources for workspaces in PipelineRuns [Source 1 is from previous conversation but no source in current materials].
*   **Tekton Chains**: This is a mechanism to **secure the software supply chain by recording events in a user-defined pipeline**. Tekton Chains generates and signs provenance, which contains information from the PipelineRun that created the attested artifact, including input parameters and task results. It operates in a separate namespace and has exclusive access to the private key for signing provenance, ensuring accuracy and authenticity.
*   **Tekton Results**: This mechanism **stores PipelineRun and TaskRun metadata in a separate database and pod logs in cloud storage**. Once stored, the original resources are removed from the cluster. There is a Tekton Results API for accessing these details.
*   **Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)**: Tekton objects like Tasks, TaskRuns, Pipelines, and PipelineRuns are implemented as CRDs.
*   **Tekton Triggers**: These are related to events and are part of the Tekton ecosystem.

### How is Tekton Built? (Something to Have in Consideration)

When building or configuring Tekton, several factors are important:

*   **Kubernetes Foundation**: Tekton extends Kubernetes functionality, with its objects implemented as Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs). This means understanding Kubernetes concepts is beneficial.
*   **Pipeline Definition Location**: PipelineRun YAML files **must be located in the root `.tekton` directory of a repository**. This directory is reserved for Tekton-specific functionality.
*   **Templating**: **Pipelines as Code (PaC) tries to be as close to the Tekton template as possible**. Users typically write their templates and save them with a `.yaml` extension in the `.tekton/` directory.
*   **Customization**: You can customize generated PipelineRun YAML files by adding custom Tasks. These custom tasks can be defined directly in the PipelineRun file using `taskSpec` or referenced from external locations (e.g., Tekton bundles).
*   **Resource Allocation**: **Compute resources (CPU/memory) can be set at the task level using `computeResources` or for specific steps using `stepSpecs`** within the Tekton task definition. The default Tekton workspace size is 1GB, but this can be increased by modifying the `workspace volumeclaimtemplate` in your Tekton files.
*   **Reusability with `pipelineRef`**: To simplify configurations and promote reusability across multiple components, you can use `pipelineRef` to point to a common pipeline file.
*   **Dynamic Variables**: Tags within pipelines can utilize **dynamic variables provided by Pipelines as Code**, such as `pull_request_number`, `source_branch`, or `target_branch`.
*   **Multi-architecture Support**: Tekton pipelines can be adapted for multi-architecture builds by adding specific tasks for each architecture.
*   **Internal Directories**: Tekton reserves the `/tekton/` directory for internal usage within containers, with specific subdirectories like `/tekton/results` being stable and covered by API compatibility, while others are internal implementation details.
*   **Schema Validation**: PaC provides **OpenAPI schema validation for its Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)**, which helps ensure correctness when writing Repository resources.
*   **Local Development**: Tekton can be run locally using tools like Docker Desktop, Minikube, or Kind, with specific prerequisites for each.

### How Does Tekton Work?

Tekton operates by:

*   **Event-Driven Execution**: Konflux triggers Tekton PipelineRuns primarily in response to **pull request and push events** in a Git repository. Manual triggers are also possible.
*   **Git Integration**: **Pipeline as Code defines pipelines as source code in Git**. Tekton processes PipelineRuns defined in the `.tekton` directory of a repository.
*   **Resolving Resources**: Tekton uses **resolvers (e.g., `git`, `bundle`) to refer to Pipelines or Tasks located in remote locations**, such as Git repositories or Tekton bundles. All Konflux tasks are pushed as Tekton bundles.
*   **Parameterization**: PipelineRuns can be parameterized to customize execution with specific inputs and outputs. This includes passing arguments via the Tekton file or using a build-args file.
*   **Conditional Execution**: Similar pipelines (e.g., for pull requests vs. pushes) can be combined using conditional logic based on parameters like `is_pull_request`.
*   **Metadata and Provenance**: Tekton Chains generates SLSA provenance, which is authenticated metadata about software artifacts, including input parameters and task results from the PipelineRun. This provenance is signed by Tekton Chains outside of user workspaces.
*   **Error Handling**: If a Tekton task fails, an excerpt of the last three lines from the task breakdown is displayed [Source 1 is from previous conversation but no source in current materials].

### Which Would be a Normal Use Case of Tekton?

Tekton is a versatile CI/CD framework with many applications:

*   **Application Build and Test**: The primary use is to **build application components into images from a source repository and perform initial functional and security checks**. This includes running build-time tests, custom tests, and integration tests.
*   **Custom CI/CD Pipelines**: Users can **define and run their own custom Tekton pipelines** tailored to specific project requirements.
*   **Software Supply Chain Security**: Leveraging Tekton Chains, it provides capabilities for securing the software supply chain by generating and signing provenance attestations (e.g., SLSA provenance). This includes running vulnerability scanning (Clair), anti-virus (ClamAV), and SAST tools (e.g., Snyk).
*   **Automated Releases**: Tekton pipelines are integral to the release process within Konflux, automating the validation of release conditions and execution of release actions, such as pushing images to Quay.io and managing releases to the Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog.
*   **Managing Multiple Versions/Streams**: Tekton supports building and managing multiple product versions or release streams in parallel.
*   **Dependency Management**: Tools like Mintmaker, which leverages Renovate Bot, use Tekton pipelines to automate dependency updates (e.g., Git submodules or Tekton task digests).
*   **Integration Testing Framework**: Tekton tasks support dynamic application testing, including integration with external systems and services like Testing Farm, RapiDAST, and OpenShift CI (Prow). It can also be used for chaos testing.
*   **Building OLM Operators and FBCs**: Tekton is used to build OLM Operator, bundle, and File-Based Catalog (FBC) images, including managing image references and generating catalogs.
*   **Collecting Metrics**: Tekton is used to collect metrics, such as build time, secure scan time, and test time, for each pipeline.

### What Should I Have in Consideration to Monitor to Ensure Functionality?

To ensure the functionality of Tekton pipelines within Konflux, consider monitoring:

*   **PipelineRun Status and Logs**: **Regularly checking the status and logs of PipelineRuns in the Konflux UI is crucial for debugging and identifying failures**. Accessing detailed logs via Tekton Results can provide more in-depth information.
*   **Enterprise Contract (EC) Violations**: **Monitor the Security tab in the Konflux UI for detailed information on EC failures**, as these indicate non-compliance with security policies. Understanding EC policies and configuring exceptions is important.
*   **Tekton Controller Status**: **Be aware of potential issues with the Tekton Chains controller (e.g., being overloaded or crashlooping)**, as this can affect pipeline execution and provenance generation. General Tekton controller issues can also impact functionality.
*   **Resource Usage**: Monitor for resource-related failures, such as tasks or pipelines running out of memory or disk space. Tekton has default workspace sizes that may need to be increased for larger builds. Resource requests and limits for tasks should be properly configured.
*   **Renovate/Mintmaker Updates**: Ensure that Mintmaker/Renovate Bot is correctly triggering and processing updates for Tekton pipelines and dependencies. Issues with parsing Tekton YAML files or automatic merging can occur.
*   **API Character Limits**: Be aware that API character limits may restrict the output of error reports to only the first failed task [Source 1 is from previous conversation but no source in current materials].
*   **Documentation and Support**: Utilize the available documentation, including troubleshooting guides and FAQs. If issues persist, **use the "Ask for Support" workflow** rather than general discussions to ensure proper tracking and resolution.
*   **Conforma Rule Changes**: A feature to create a "conforma monitor" is planned to track Conforma rules that are transitioning from warnings to violations to prevent unexpected blockers.
*   **Performance Metrics**: There is an ongoing effort to improve platform performance, including the UI, and requests have been made for metrics tagged with repository and pipeline information to measure performance per repository.
