Pipelines-as-Code (PaC) in Konflux can experience a range of performance issues, leading to delays, stuck pipeline runs, and failures. These problems often stem from interactions with the underlying infrastructure, internal Tekton logic, and specific configurations.

Here are the key factors contributing to PaC performance issues:

*   **Tekton Backend and Controller Issues**
    *   **Tekton Results Slowness and Data Loss:** The Konflux UI can be **unusable and slow (often >30 seconds to load)** when displaying PipelineRun details, component lists, or Enterprise Contract reports. Logs can be incomplete, missing, or disappear too fast, making debugging difficult. This is frequently attributed to the backend database (Tekton Results) struggling to keep up with the workload, or logs being garbage collected before being fully written to storage. The primary issue is the **high load on the Results database**, requiring design improvements.
    *   **Tekton Chains Overload:** Tekton Chains, responsible for build time signatures, can become overloaded or crashloop. If the Chains controller cannot process build pipelines, the Integration Service might not react, as PipelineRuns need to be marked as signed. Issues with Chains processing a PipelineRun before its completion can also lead to TaskRuns not being found.
    *   **Tekton Pipeline Controller Bottlenecks:** Delays can occur between PipelineRun creation and TaskRun initiation, or TaskRuns becoming stuck in pending, even without resource quota issues. This can be exacerbated if the Tekton controller pods are evicted due to node memory shortages, especially if they are not explicitly configured with CPU/memory requests. There's also a specific bug where the Pipelines Controller TaskRun reconciler can have a huge workqueue depth (e.g., 2000 items), causing simple tasks to take minutes between creation and start time.
    *   **Tekton Resolver Timeouts and Memory Issues:** Tasks can fail to be retrieved because resolution takes longer than the global timeout (e.g., 1 minute). This is frequently linked to the `tekton-pipelines-remote-resolvers` pod crashing due to **lack of memory (OOMKilled)**, especially with large repositories. A known bug exists in the resolver controller related to memory usage for large Git repositories (e.g., 145MB repo leads to 92MB shallow clone, causing memory issues).
    *   **Admission Webhook Failures:** `webhook.pipeline.tekton.dev` can report `context deadline exceeded` errors, indicating intermittent performance issues or overloaded/crashing Tekton controllers.
    *   **Tekton Updates and Validation:** Upgrading OpenShift Pipelines can cause outages if existing resources are in certain states. Newer Tekton versions impose stricter validation on resources, which can lead to failures if existing configurations are no longer compliant.

*   **Infrastructure and Resource Shortages**
    *   **Insufficient Compute Quotas:** Pipeline runs frequently fail or are significantly delayed because tasks exceed allocated CPU, memory, or ephemeral storage quotas, preventing pods from being created or scheduling them slowly. PVC (Persistent Volume Claim) quota issues are also common, particularly with multi-platform builds.
    *   **etcd Database Overload:** Keeping too many PipelineRuns (PLRs) or TaskRuns (TLRs) for an extended duration can create **significant stress on the etcd database**, degrading overall cluster performance. Slowness can become noticeable with around 5,000 PLRs. Resource quota evaluation timeouts are ultimately linked to etcd load. Efforts are ongoing to optimize storage usage in etcd and implement pipeline queuing.
    *   **Multi-Platform Controller (MPC) Limitations:** MPC machine pools often have a **static size**, leading to builds being queued and timing out while waiting for an available VM. Bugs in MPC can cause it to "forget about" VMs or fail to react in time for VM creation, resulting in errors like "Mount secret not found". Contention for s390x and ppc64le resources is a recurring bottleneck.
    *   **Slow VM Provisioning:** The process of provisioning ephemeral environments for multi-platform builds can be time-consuming (minutes to tens of minutes), contributing to task timeouts.
    *   **Network Issues:** Intermittent network failures, registry latency, or slowness during image pull/push operations from registries like Quay.io are frequent causes of build timeouts and failures.
    *   **High Concurrent Load:** A "thundering herd" of PRs or builds, particularly when many are triggered concurrently (e.g., by Renovate updates), can cause massive spikes in resource usage, leading to longer wait times, timeouts, and quota depletion.

*   **Pipeline and Configuration Specific Factors**
    *   **Misconfigured YAML:** Konflux may silently crash or wait for pipelines to timeout if it encounters misconfigured YAML (e.g., asking for too much RAM/CPU in task definitions, or YAML syntax errors), providing **zero indication to the user**. Malformed Tekton pipelines (e.g., invalid parameters, unknown fields) can prevent runs.
    *   **Outdated/Incorrect Task References:** Pipelines can fail due to "Tasks that don't exist" or "untrusted task" errors when using outdated Tekton task references or bundle images. Automated updates might override user customizations in Tekton files.
    *   **Timeout Configuration:** While Tekton allows setting timeouts at the pipeline, task, and step levels, there are instances where Tekton seems to ignore user-defined timeout annotations or it's incorrectly applied, defaulting to a cluster-wide limit (e.g., 2 hours). Incorrectly set timeouts can cause pipelines to fail prematurely.
    *   **Large Repositories and `.tekton` Folder:** Repositories with a large number of components or Tekton files (e.g., 224 pipeline run YAML files, or 32 files in `.tekton` folder) can contribute to issues. Very large repositories (e.g., 78MB) can cause the Tekton resolver to time out during cloning due to inefficient Go-Git library memory usage.
    *   **Incomplete/Silent Error Reporting:** PaC may not provide clear error messages for YAML validation or CEL expression templating issues, making debugging difficult.
    *   **Unintended Pipeline Triggers:** Misconfigured `on-cel-expression` annotations or other event matching logic can cause pipelines to be triggered unnecessarily (e.g., on label updates, or when PRs are approved/merged), leading to "noisy" runs and resource consumption.
    *   **Serialization and Parallelization Issues:** Some pipeline designs inherently require sequential execution (e.g., due to shared EC2 instances or specific testing setups), which can bottleneck overall pipeline speed, especially for multi-architecture builds or complex release processes. Race conditions can occur if multiple release pipelines run concurrently.
    *   **Enterprise Contract (EC) Performance:** EC validation can be very time-consuming (e.g., 3.5 hours for 40 components), significantly delaying releases. This is CPU/memory intensive.
    *   **Long Resource Names:** Extremely long resource names can cause Tekton to overflow its internal result data model, leading to pipelines hanging indefinitely.

*   **External System Issues**
    *   **GitHub API Rate Limiting:** Pipelines-as-Code (PaC) can bug GitHub's API frequently, leading to rate limits and stuck pipeline statuses in GitHub PRs.

*   **Intermittent Issues:** Many failures are described as "transient" or "intermittent" without clear root causes, often requiring repeated re-runs to succeed.
