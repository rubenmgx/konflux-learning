Within Konflux, components primarily interact through a mechanism called **"nudging"**. This allows for the automatic updating of references between components, particularly when changes in one component necessitate updates in another.

Here's a breakdown of how components interact in Konflux:

*   **Components and Applications**: In Konflux, an **Application** serves as a collection of **Components**. Components are typically container images that you want to build, test, and release. Testing and releasing generally occur at the application level, meaning if you want to test and release multiple container images together, they should be part of the same application. While one Konflux component can be built based on changes in multiple Maven modules, it can be technically complex to set up and maintain.

*   **Nudging Mechanism**:
    *   **Purpose**: Nudging is used to **automatically generate pull requests (PRs) to update image digests** (SHA256 references) between related components. This is particularly useful when an "operator image" (nudging component) needs to update a "bundle" (nudged component) with its new digest.
    *   **How it Works**: When a nudging component's push pipeline successfully finishes, Konflux identifies the reference of the newly built image, including its digest. It then searches for occurrences of this image in the repositories of all "nudged" components and replaces the old digest with the new one. This process then triggers a new build in the nudged component's repository.
    *   **Triggering Events**: Nudging is triggered exclusively by **push builds**, not by pull request (PR) builds.
    *   **Configuration**: Component relationships for nudging can be defined either through the **Konflux UI** or via a CLI approach. An example of this is seen in the `olm-operator-konflux-sample` documentation. These relationships are specified using the `spec.build-nudges-ref` field in the component's specification.
    *   **Scope**: Nudging typically occurs **only within the same namespace/application**. Although there have been discussions and feature requests for cross-application nudging, it is not natively supported to simply nudge a component in another workspace or application through configuration.

*   **Challenges with Nudging (Many-to-One)**:
    *   A significant limitation is the current **inefficiency of "many-to-one" nudging**, particularly for operator bundles that depend on numerous component images. When multiple dependent component images are updated, each individual component build triggers a *separate* nudge to the bundle. This creates a "fan-in" configuration, resulting in a cascade of **unnecessary bundle rebuilds**, with only the final bundle containing all the updated image SHAs being valid. This issue is tracked by KONFLUX-8243, KFLUXSPRT-2432, TRACING-5039, and RELDEL-4439.
    *   This "fan-in" problem leads to wasted resources, is time-consuming, and can be fragile to configure correctly with `on-cel-expression` annotations.

*   **Renovate and MintMaker**:
    *   Konflux uses **Renovate** as its core for dependency management, which is part of a service called **MintMaker**. MintMaker automatically manages dependency updates and creates merge requests (MRs) to update build pipeline task references to their latest versions.
    *   Renovate runs every four hours by default and is enabled for each component. While it automates PR creation, users are responsible for merging these PRs. If not merged in time, it can eventually lead to a failing Enterprise Contract Policy check.

*   **Snapshots and Integration Tests**:
    *   After a successful build pipeline, a **snapshot** is created, representing the state of all built artifacts for an application. This snapshot includes the newly produced component and references to other components from the application's "Global Candidate List". Each new image updates this map, and each version of that map is a snapshot.
    *   Integration tests in Konflux are designed to ensure that all components **within an application** work together. These tests run against an application's snapshot.
    *   In mono-repositories with multiple components, each component build can trigger integration tests for the entire application, which might not be desired. There are options to run integration tests only for specific components using contexts like `component_COMPONENT_NAME`. However, if only one component build is completed, the "group context" for integration tests might not run.
    *   There is a feature (KONFLUX-2687) aimed at enabling in-PR testing of component nudging relationships to group test both the operand and bundle changes before merging.

*   **Configuration and UI Challenges**:
    *   There have been reports of UI issues where component relationships, especially "nudged by" properties, are not properly updated or displayed after changes (e.g., removal of nudges via CLI/OpenShift still shows them in UI). This can lead to inconsistencies where components are *showing* as being nudged even when they are not.
    *   When components are created manually or via `konflux-release-data` and then re-onboarded, issues with pipeline triggers and correctly configured resources can occur due to potential race conditions during ArgoCD sync and Kubernetes garbage collection.
    *   Konflux components require unique names, even if they belong to different applications or represent different versions of the same repository.
    *   When you onboard a component via the Konflux UI, it automatically creates `Application`, `Component`, and `ImageRepository` objects in your OpenShift namespace and typically proposes a PR to your repository to set up `Pipelines as Code` (.tekton files). Subsequent configuration changes in the UI might also trigger PRs to update the `.tekton` files.
