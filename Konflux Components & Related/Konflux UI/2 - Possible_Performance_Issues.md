Konflux UI performance issues can stem from a variety of factors, including underlying infrastructure problems, data handling challenges, and specific UI design flaws.

Here are the key causes of Konflux UI performance issues identified in the sources:

*   **Backend and Infrastructure Overload**
    *   **Slow Tekton Results Queries**: A frequently cited issue is that UI responses are significantly impacted by slow queries to the Tekton Results API. This can cause pages to take 30 seconds or more to load, and can also lead to missing or incomplete logs and TaskRuns. The UI's queries to Tekton Results have changed, necessitating adaptation of the database indexing, which is an ongoing effort. Konflux uses an older, forked version of Tekton Results, and an upgrade is in progress.
    *   **Etcd Issues**: Problems with the Etcd database, such as database space being exceeded, have caused Konflux UI outages and slow performance. Cleaning Etcd or optimizing clusters to handle the load are proposed solutions.
    *   **High Cluster Load & Resource Contention**: When many pipelines are running simultaneously, especially due to events like Renovate PRs generating a "pipeline storm," it can overwhelm the cluster resources, leading to general system slowness that impacts the UI. This can also manifest as pipelines failing or timing out due to a lack of available resources or an overloaded resolver. Plans are in place to optimize secret mounting for builds to allow increased tenant quotas and implement pipeline queuing to manage resource allocation.
    *   **Proxy Component Issues and Gateway Timeouts**: Users have reported 502 and 504 "Bad Gateway" errors or general "Gateway Timeout" messages, indicating problems with proxy components or the API endpoints that the UI relies on.
    *   **Inability to Handle Large Scale**: The UI struggles to load a large number of components, with reports of it failing to load 250 components for an application. Similarly, handling many images in a snapshot can lead to extended Enterprise Contract evaluation times.
    *   **General Cluster Unstability**: Intermittent and sporadic issues, including the Konflux UI being entirely "down" or "non-responsive," are often attributed to broader cluster performance and stability problems that are under continuous investigation by Konflux infrastructure and performance teams.

*   **Data and API-Related UI Specific Issues**
    *   **Missing or Unavailable Logs**: A common complaint is that logs for PipelineRuns and TaskRuns disappear quickly after completion, sometimes within minutes, due to an "aggressive pruner" of Konflux cluster objects. This prevents the UI from displaying them effectively. This is a known UI/Tekton Results API bug.
    *   **Stale or Incorrect Data Display**: The UI may show outdated information, such as an old component build as the latest, or incorrectly display "Merge pull request" status when no such PR exists. There can also be mismatches between the Konflux UI and other data sources like GitHub or release pipeline data.
    *   **Specific View/Navigation Issues**: Certain parts of the UI, like the "security tab" for logs or release-related views, might not load correctly. There are also reports of the UI rendering errors on first load or re-navigation, which are temporarily resolved by refreshing the page but reappear upon navigating back. Problems with "infinite scroll" not loading subsequent data have also been noted.

*   **UI Design and User Experience Flaws**
    *   **Excessive Data Loading**: The UI can be slow due to loading every CRD on the cluster and downloading large snapshots and other resources, even if only a single application's pipeline run is requested.
    *   **Lack of User Feedback**: The UI may not provide clear error messages or indications when a user's Tekton pipeline is misconfigured (e.g., requesting too much RAM/CPU), leading to silent crashes or timeouts without diagnostic information.
    *   **Limited UI Functionality**: Users have expressed frustration over the inability to perform certain critical actions directly from the UI, such as easily rerunning specific failed pipelines (only the latest commit can be re-run from the UI) or easily triggering new builds for components. The UI's handling of multiple components, such as displaying index images, can also be problematic.
    *   **General Bad UX**: The overall developer experience with Konflux and its UI is acknowledged as a challenge, with some design choices leading to confusion, such as the UI's assumption that every new component is entirely separate. Compatibility issues with frontend frameworks like PF6 have also been mentioned.

*   **External and User-Side Factors**
    *   **User Connectivity Issues**: Problems like a disconnecting VPN can lead to the Konflux UI not loading or showing "Access Denied" errors.
    *   **Rate Limiting**: Opening too many Konflux UI tabs or frequent refreshing can cause users to be rate-limited by the load balancer, temporarily preventing access.
    *   **Intermittent Login Issues**: Users occasionally experience temporary issues logging into or accessing their workspaces on various Konflux clusters.

Konflux teams are actively working on improving performance and stability, with many issues being tracked in internal bug reports. A "new UI" is also available, which some users report as being significantly faster than the old one.
